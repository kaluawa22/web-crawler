How to run script. 
- My script takes 3 commands. The number of words to return, the URL of the site, and the list of excluded words. 
- example - main.py -mf 10 -ew Microsoft -url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft
    where -mf is most frequent, -ew is excluded words and -url is the page we are scraping.
